# Introduction
 
This's the partial of [the whole mapping scheme](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki/Skema#Implementasi) of our [₠Quantum Project](https://github.com/eq19) that's taking a scheme called **[DNA Recombination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA#Genetic_recombination): [M+F](https://github.com/eq19/quantum/blob/workflows/_layouts/feed.rb) to [C1+C2](https://github.com/eq19/quantum/blob/workflows/_includes/data/roots.rb)**.

```note
Recombination involves the breaking and rejoining of two chromosomes (M and F) to produce two rearranged chromosomes (C1 and C2).

```tip
By Our Project this **Sheme** runs as a _[remote theme](https://www.eq19.com/theme)_ where the **Symbols** are:
* The _**M+F**_ symbol will stand as: [Project Maps (M)](https://www.eq19.com/maps) + [Project Feed (F)](https://www.eq19.com/feed) while
* _**C1+C2**_ as implementations, see sample: [Project Base (C1)](https://chetabahana.github.io/) + [Project Core (C2)](https://chetabahana.com/).
```

This sample was developed by converting [₠Quantum](https://github.com/eq19) to [eCommerce](https://github.com/MarketLeader) using two (2) kinds of cyclic algorithm acting as _[Lexer and Parser](https://www.javacodegeeks.com/2017/09/guide-parsing-algorithms-terminology.html)_.

[![Lexer and Parser](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/70385860-e5074f00-19c3-11ea-92f3-ec6f33bf9774.png)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2842809/lexers-vs-parsers)

They will work base on the correlation between **168=π(1000)** as lexer and **618=1000/Φ** as parser So let's call them as the syntax of **[168](#tabulate-prime-by-the-power-of-168)** vs **[618](#next-target-tabulate-prime-by-618)**.

```
1000 = 10³ (Triple Ten)
π(1000) = 168 (Basic Primes)
Φ = 1000/618 = 1,618 (Golden Ratio) 
Δ(1,6,18) = 61+28 = 89 (Mersenne Primes) 
```

Each cycles will have a total of **seven (7) steps prime algorithm** on base 10 that consist of three (3) **leading** steps by the power of 168: [Q19(10, **29**)](#1st-step-q1910-29), [Q17(30, **36**)](#2nd-step-q1730-36), [Q13(37, **114**)](#3rd-step-q1337-114) and four (4) **lagging** steps by 618: [Q7(**113**, 90)](#4th-step-q7113-90), [Q5(**89**, 29)](#5th-step-q589-29), [Q3(**28**, 19)](#6th-step-q328-19), [Q2(**18**, 10)](#7th-step-q218-10).

[![generate the prime](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/107818705-98c75400-6daa-11eb-8138-d6da7ceef4fd.png)](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/tensorflow/wiki/Programming)

By having digital root of (five) 5 and two (2), the above seven (7) steps of 168 and 618 is organized using the primes **23 and 11** respectively. So all together will finaly form as 10 primes in sequent that initiated with **10th prime = 29** as their _[base frame](base)_.

This algorithm is used to regenerate a _[Basic Grammar](#basic-grammar)_ between [<code>user</code>](#6th-step-q328-19) and [<code>organization</code>](#7th-step-q218-10) accounts in GitHub. It is being tested for _[eBranding](#next-release)_ to proof that it is adaptable for every kinds of implementation or application as explained further below.
